/// A `Rule` describes a logical implication, which is commonly denoted as
/// `p -> q` in mathematics, where `->` means "implies".
///
/// In this system, it is described as `LHS => RHS`, where `=>` is read as
/// "then". The whole rule is read colloquially as:
///
/// _"If the LHS is true, then the RHS declares this fact."_
///
/// The RHS (or right hand side) of a `Rule` declares a fact. The fact is an
/// `answer` for a `question`. An `Brain` is used to get the `answer` of a
/// `question`.
///
/// The LHS (or left hand side) of a `Rule` is comprised of two parts:
/// - its `priority` ranks the importance of the `Rule` relative to others.
/// - its `predicate` can be evaluated to a `Bool`, given a `Facts`.
///
/// The RHS (or right hand side) of a `Rule` is comprised of three parts:
/// - a `question`, which is the identifier for a fact.
///
/// Given a set of `Rule`s with the same RHS `question`, the `Rule` that "wins"
/// or "takes effect" or "applies" is the one with the highest `priority`
/// amongst the subset of `Rules` whose `predicate` evaluates to `true` in a
/// given `Facts`.
///
/// When a rule takes effect, the inferred fact it declared is remembered in the
/// `Facts`. The `Facts` knows which other questions were needed to determine
/// the answer to the inferred fact and uses that information to forget inferred
/// answers when they're no longer valid because the answers to those other
/// questions changed.
///
/// - note: a `Rule` is invalid if its `predicate` contains its `question`.
