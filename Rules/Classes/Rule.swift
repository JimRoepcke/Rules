/// A `Rule` describes a logical implication, which is commonly denoted as
/// `p -> q` in mathematics, where `->` means "implies".
///
/// In this system, it is described as `LHS => RHS`, where `=>` is read as
/// "then". The whole rule is read colloquially as:
///
/// _"If the LHS is true, then the RHS declares this fact."_
///
/// The RHS (or right hand side) of a `Rule` declares a fact. The fact is a
/// `value` for a `key`. An `Engine` is used to get the `value` of a `key`.
///
/// The LHS (or left hand side) of a `Rule` is comprised of two parts:
/// - its `priority` ranks the importance of the `Rule` relative to others.
/// - its `predicate` can be evaluated to a `Bool`, given a `Context`.
///
/// The RHS (or right hand side) of a `Rule` is comprised of three parts:
/// - a `key`, which is the identifier for the
///
/// Given a set of `Rule`s with the same RHS `key`, the `Rule` that "wins" or
/// "takes effect" or "applies" is the one with the highest `priority` amongst
/// the subset of `Rules` whose `predicate` evaluates to `true` in a given
/// `Context`.
///
/// When a rule takes effect, the fact it declared is cached in the `Context`.
/// The `Context` knows which other values were considered 
///
/// - note: a `Rule` is invalid if its `predicate` contains the RHS `key`.
